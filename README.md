# CMSC-335-Projects
#### This repo contains the SeaPort Project Series from CMSC-335.

In Project 1, I created a program that read a data file, created the internal data structure, created a GUI to display the structure, and let
the user search the structure. You can find the rubric for Project 1 in the Rubrics folder, titled Project 1 Rubric.

In Project 2, I added the ability to sort the structure, and used hash maps to create the structure more efficiently. You can find the rubric for Project 2 in the Rubrics folder, titled Project 2 Rubric.

In Project 3, I created a thread for each job, which could not run until the ship had a dock, and created the GUI to show the
progress of each job. You can find the rubric for Project 3 in the Rubrics folder, titled Project 3 Rubric.

In Project 4, I simulated competition for resources (persons with particular skills) for each job. You can find the rubric for Project 4 in the Rubrics folder, titled Project 4 Rubric.

><h1>Object-Oriented and Concurrent Programming</h1>
><h2>CMSC 335</h2>
><p>A study of object-oriented and concurrent programming using features of Java. The goal is to design, implement, test, debug, and document complex robust programs in an object-oriented language. Concepts of object-oriented programming (such as composition, classification, and polymorphism) are explored. Topics include the principles of concurrent programming (such as task synchronization, race conditions, deadlock, threads, and event-driven graphic user interface programs). Programming projects are implemented in Java.</p>
